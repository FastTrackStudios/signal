//! How a fixed-aspect faceplate fits into a resizable editor window.
//!
//! A hardware panel is a physical object: the rack ears, the VU cutout and the
//! knob spacing are one drawing, and reflowing them the way a web layout
//! reflows is exactly the thing that stops it looking like a unit. So the
//! panel keeps its design size and is drawn at a single scale factor instead —
//! which also sidesteps blitz's habit of collapsing what does not fit rather
//! than clipping it, since at any scale the panel fits by construction.
//!
//! Geometry only; the components multiply their pixel sizes by
//! [`fit_scale`].

/// Smallest scale a panel is drawn at. Below this the silkscreen stops being
/// readable, and a too-small window is better served by an oversized panel
/// cropped by the window than by an unreadable one.
pub const MIN_SCALE: f64 = 0.55;
/// Largest scale. Past roughly twice the design size a faceplate is just a
/// blurry enlargement, and the extra window space is better left as margin.
pub const MAX_SCALE: f64 = 2.0;

/// The scale factor that fits a `design_w` x `design_h` panel inside a
/// `win_w` x `win_h` window without distorting it.
///
/// One factor for both axes — a panel stretched on one axis reads as a
/// rendering bug, not as a bigger unit.
